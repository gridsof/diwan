## Welcome to Algerian Diwan

Salam, I am an amateur musician with a huge interest in traditional algerian music especially Diwan. Diwan is a genre of Gnawa music based in Algeria. It shares some similar practices and instruments with other Gnawa styles from other african countries. This page will serve as an introductory source for everyone interesting in this music and culture. I will try to update and add new informations, this will depend on my free time.
